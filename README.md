This notebook consists of Python code that contains an example of Harris Corner Detection with OpenCV, a comparison of how much time for-loop convolution takes vs. Numpy-based convolution, and performing binary classification on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset by using a Logistic Regression model after applying Feature Extraction to detect the edges of the images.
